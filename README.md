# space-invaders
ðŸŽ® A simple Space Invaders game built using Python and Pygame â€“ ideal for beginners learning game development!

This project was created after taking help and inspiration from a YouTube tutorial(Freecodecamp).  
Some concepts, logic, and structure were guided by the tutorial, while I implemented and practiced them in my own way to understand better.

Special thanks to the creator of the channel for the guidance!

> Note: This project is meant for learning and personal growth.
